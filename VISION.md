# FitClub Vision Statement
FitClub will is an app to plan or build workout routines and learn gym exercises. It provides a selection of pre-built workout plans, allows for workout plan customization, and provides guides for performing various exercises. 

FitClub is designed for gym goers of all ability levels looking for a structured workout experience. The app allows gym goers to plan their workout routines before they start exercising to increase overall gym time efficiency and improve workout quality. 

The app encourages more time exercising and less time deciding which exercises to do. For gym goers with little or no gym experience, this app provides a structured workout program through the availability of ready-made workout plans. Some of the major functions of the app are the ability to search exercises and add them to a favourites list, which allows users to find their favourite exercises quickly. Another one is the being able to plan a workout, which allows gym goers to create their own workout routine so they can select exercises that they enjoy doing more than others.

The main goal of this project is to optimize user engagement by enabling them to view personalized and engaging content which helps them to achieve their desired set of goals while simultaneously boosting their motivation. This project will be considered successful if FitClub is able to achieve a satisfactory rating, 3+ stars out of 5, through surveys from at least 70% of users after a continuous 3-month usage period.
