The purpose of this project is to create a workout app, called FitClub, in Android Studio for gym goers with all levels of gym experience. FitClub offers user the ability to create a custom workout, as well as select excerises from a wide variety of exercises pre-loaded into the app. Additionally users can favourite these exercises to be able to quickly view them again.
